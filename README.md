# Mod of Power Algorithm
 The Mod of Power Algorithm involves designing an efficient algorithm to calculate the result of the expression 𝑩^𝑷 mod 𝑴 for large values of B, P, and M. The challenge lies in efficiently performing calculations involving large exponents and taking the modulus of the result to prevent exceeding the data type's range.
