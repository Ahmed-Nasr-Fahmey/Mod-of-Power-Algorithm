# Mod of Power Algorithm

## Description

The "Mod of Power Algorithm" project involves designing an efficient algorithm to calculate the result of the expression 𝑩^𝑷 mod 𝑴 for large values of B, P, and M. The challenge lies in efficiently performing calculations involving large exponents and taking the modulus of the result to prevent exceeding the data type's range.

## Problem Statement

Given the values of B, P, and M, the goal is to compute the value of B raised to the power P and then take the modulus M of the result. Traditional direct calculations of 𝑩^𝑷 can lead to values that are out of the range of any data type, necessitating an optimized algorithm to compute the result while keeping it within bounds.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Algorithm Design**: Develop an algorithm that efficiently calculates 𝑩^𝑷 mod 𝑴 for large values of B, P, and M.

- **Modular Arithmetic Theorem**: Utilize the theorem of modular arithmetic [(A × B × C) mod N = [(A mod N) × (B mod N) × (C mod N)] mod N] to perform intermediate calculations while staying within the data type's range.

## Implementation

The project involves implementing a solution that applies the modular arithmetic theorem to compute 𝑩^𝑷 mod 𝑴 efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
